# Resolving Python with Data Science

## Introduction

The aim of the course is to help you excel in Python applied to Data Science.

Every `chapter` contains 2 types of files:

- `Sessions` to develop the code at the same time we learn the concepts.
- `Practices` to work on your own and enhance the concepts covered in `sessions`.

You may observe how I have resolved the materials with my students [here](https://github.com/jsulopz/resolving-python-data-science/network/members).

## About the Materials

Over the past years I have been teaching more than 300 people with 3.000+ hours of Private Tutoring Lessons. At the same time, some companies or employees had hired me as a consultant.

Everytime I made a lesson, I tried innovative ways to make people understand Python, Programming & Machine Learning at the same time, with practical use cases.

From all the materials I have received from my clients, I have condensed those notes and my experience in a program that doesn't stop improving.

## Instructions to Use the Materials

You may well use it by `downloading` the `Code` or by `clonning` to your computer:

```zsh
git clone git@github.com:jsulopz/machine-learning-program.git
```
