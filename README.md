# Resolving Python with Data Science

## Introduction

The aim of the course is to help you excel in Python applied to Data Science.

Every `chapter` contains 2 types of files:

- `Sessions` to develop the code at the same time we learn the concepts.
- `Practices` to work on your own and enhance the concepts covered in `sessions`.

You may observe how I have resolved the materials with my students [here](https://github.com/jsulopz/resolving-python-data-science/network/members).

## Roadmap

1. Open the `terminal` and ↓

```
git clone https://github.com/jsulopz/resolving-python-data-science.git
```

2. Make sure you have [installed anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and type within the terminal ↓

```
jupyter lab
```

3. Start working on the `jupyter notebooks` within each chapter

## Structure

The materials are **cautiously** ordered. It is recommended that you follow it, otherwise you may not unleash its potential because I'll make you think from the very beginning some errors that always prompt and even experienced programmers don't quite understand.

### 05 Resolving Python for Professionals

Most companies don't quite unleash the potential of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning yet. They focus on transporting, processing and visualizing data.

Here you will learn the top concepts you'll need for most Data Science Jobs.

## About the Materials

Over the past years I have been teaching more than 400 people with 4.000+ hours of Private Tutoring Lessons. At the same time, some companies or employees had hired me as a consultant.

Everytime I made a lesson, I tried innovative ways to make people understand Python, Programming & Machine Learning at the same time, with practical use cases.

From all the materials I have received from my clients, I have condensed those notes and my experience in a program that doesn't stop improving.

## Instructions to Use the Materials

You may well use it by `downloading` the `Code` or by `clonning` to your computer:

```zsh
git clone git@github.com:jsulopz/machine-learning-program.git
```
